# Fire Detection Video Processing

This project utilizes a YOLO model to detect fire in video files, annotating each frame where fire is detected and producing an output video with these annotations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `ultralytics`
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `gradio`

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision ultralytics opencv-python numpy gradio
```

## Usage

1. **Model Placement**: Ensure the YOLO model file (`last.pt`) is located in the same directory as the Python script.

2. **Running the Script**: Execute the Python script to start the Gradio web interface:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Using the Web Interface**: Once the script is running, a web interface will launch. Upload a video file through this interface. The system will process the video, detect any instances of fire, and provide an annotated video as output.

## Notes

- **Device Selection**: The script automatically selects the best available device for processingâ€”GPU (`cuda`), Apple's Metal Performance Shaders (`mps`), or CPU (`cpu`).

- **Dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed. If you encounter issues, verify that your environment meets the specified requirements.

- **Model Compatibility**: The `last.pt` model file should be compatible with the version of the `ultralytics` package used. If you experience errors, consider updating or downgrading the package or model file accordingly.
